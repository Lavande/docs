## Pool 1: Curve yCRV

1. You'll need yCRV to farm YFII from Pool 1. Go to [Curve's Y pool](https://www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit) and deposit any one or any combo of USDT/DAI/USDC/TUSD to get yCRV.

The above transaction may cost about 0.3 ETH worth of gas, so if you're playing with a small amount of fund you may want to buy yCRV directly on [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap). Set the target token to 0xdf5e0e81dff6faf3a7e52ba697820c5e32d806a8 (yCRV) and swap.

## Pool 2: DAI-YFII Balancer

1. You need DAI in your wallet before farming. Stake assets in Maker to borrow DAI or go to your favourite exchange to buy DAI.

2. Go to the [DAI-YFII balancer pool](https://bal.yfii.finance/#/pool/0x16cAC1403377978644e78769Daa49d8f6B6CF565) and setup **Balancer Proxy** first.

   a) If you have YFII, choose **All Pool Assets**.
Unlock **DAI** and **YFII** (0xa1d0E215a23d7030842FC67cE582a6aFa3CCaB83) by sending two transactions and then they become unlocked. Input the amount you are going to deposit in either box of DAI or YFII, and the page will input the corresponding amount of the other for you. Click **Add Liquidity** to send a transaction and then you get BPT.

   b) If you don't have YFII, choose **Single Asset**. Unlock **DAI** and input your deposit amount. Then click **Add Liquidity**. The system will buy the corresponding amount of YFII needed for you and then you get BPT.
