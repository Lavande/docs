## Pool 1: Curve yCRV

If you are farming YFI, exit from YFI Pool 3 and withdraw BPT. Go to Balancer and remove liquidity to get back yCRV and YFI. You'll need yCRV to farm YFII. Below are the detailed instructions.

1. Visit https://ygov.finance/staking and connect to Metamask. Open **Governance** (Pool 3).

> Note: If you ever voted, your stake will be locked for 3 days before you can unstake.

3. Go to [yCRV/YFI pool on Balancer](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0x95C4B6C7CfF608c0CA048df8b81a484aA377172B). Choose **Max** under **All Pool Assets** and then click **Remove Liquidity** to get back your yCRV and YFI.

If you have never farmed YFI and this is the first time you farm YFII, go to the [Y pool on Curve](https://www.curve.fi/iearn/deposit) and deposit any one or any combination of USDT/DAI/USDC/TUSD to get yCRV. Don't click on other buttons other than Deposit because they may cost you extra gas.

Now you have yCRV in your wallet and are ready to farm YFII. Go to https://yfii.finance and click **Stake**. Open the **yearn** pool (Pool 1).

## Pool 2: DAI-YFII Balancer

1. You need DAI in your wallet before farming. Stake assets in Maker to borrow DAI or go to your favourite exchange to buy DAI.

2. Go to the [DAI-YFII balancer pool](https://bal.yfii.finance/#/pool/0x16cAC1403377978644e78769Daa49d8f6B6CF565) and setup **Balancer Proxy** first.

   a) If you have YFII, choose **All Pool Assets**.
Unlock **DAI** and **YFII** (0xa1d0E215a23d7030842FC67cE582a6aFa3CCaB83) by sending two transactions and then they become unlocked. Input the amount you are going to deposit in either box of DAI or YFII, and the page will input the corresponding amount of the other for you. Click **Add Liquidity** to send a transaction and then you get BPT.

   b) If you don't have YFII, choose **Single Asset**. Unlock **DAI** and input your deposit amount. Then click **Add Liquidity**. The system will buy the corresponding amount of YFII needed for you and then you get BPT.
